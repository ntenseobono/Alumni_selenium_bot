Hi {alumni_name},

My name is Ntense Obono, and I am currently a senior Computer Science major with a concentration in economics and mathematics at Carleton College.

I recently came across your LinkedIn profile and received your information from the alumni directory and noticed that your career path is quite similar to what I would like to pursue. As an individual who would like to break into the world of technology and finance, I would love just 20 minutes of your time to learn about your experience and what you do at {company} on a daily basis and what it's like to work in the field.

I am also interested in the entry-level Software Engineering position offered at {company}. I believe that my background can make me a great fit for the firm.

I have attached my resume just so you have a frame of reference for my education and experiences.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,
Ntense
